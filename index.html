If you need to change your delivery address after placing your order, then please contact the Customer Service Team to discuss this, and we will see what we can do.

If you send us an email with your stock availability request, then we will give you an estimate as to when we can expect further stock.

                    <p>We aim to release the funds that are currently reserved in your account back to your available balance within 3-5 working days of the order being cancelled.  A notification will be sent to the email address registered on your Finlux Account once our Finance team have processed the request.<br/><br/>

Please note that we do not take full payment, or receive funds, until the item has been dispatched to the customer.  When an order is placed, a pre-authorisation takes place for the full amount of the order, and these funds will be reserved within your account until such time as an order is dispatched, and the funds are released to us.  Alternatively, if an order is cancelled prior to dispatch, then the pre-authorisation request will be cancelled by our Finance department, and the card issuer will then release the funds back to your account. <br/><br/>
Your card issuer will be able to advise you how this pre-authorisation and cancellation would be shown in your account.  Note that any transactions may show as coming from “Finlux” or “Vestel”, which is our parent company. <br/><p style="color=#578bc1; font-weight: bolder;">If the problem is not resolved, please <a href="#">click here for Live Chat</a> (this will launch the Live Chat application), and an agent will be able to help you – it’s fast and free.

The faster the speed of the connection, the better, especially for web browsing, streaming videos and watching catch up TV. For standard definition videos 2MB is recommended, while for high definition videos 4MB is recommended.  The average speed offered by internet service providers (ISPs) is 12Mbps.<br/><br/>
Home Network Connectivity: Some files can be shared across your home network and viewed on your Smart TV.  You can connect multiple devices (including laptops and tablets) provided they are all on the same network.

                    <p>Whether or not you can receive Freeview HD will depend on the model of HD Ready TV that you buy.

                    <p>HD Ready TVs will only display HD broadcasts whereas Full HD TVs will do this, plus provide even greater picture quality when connected to a Full HD source, such as a Blu-ray player.<br/><br/>If your TV is HD Ready then it offers you a screen resolution of at least 1366 x 720p. Currently in the UK, TV programmes are only able to broadcast up to the HD 720p level so if you have an HD Ready TV, then you will experience TV programmes at their finest level of detail. <br/><p style="color=#578bc1; font-weight: bolder;">If the problem is not resolved, please <a href="#">click here for Live Chat</a> (this will launch the Live Chat application), and an agent will be able to help you – it’s fast and free.

                  <p class='question'>What do I need to watch 3D content?</p>
                  <div class='answer'>
                    <p>As well as a 3D TV and 3D glasses, you will need access to 3D footage. Sky offers a 3D channel, whilst Virgin Media and BT Vision provide 3D films on demand. You can also watch 3D films via Blu-ray players. If your TV is not linked to a satellite channel or Blu-ray player, it will work as a regular 2D model. <br/><p style="color=#578bc1; font-weight: bolder;">If the problem is not resolved, please <a href="#">click here for Live Chat</a> (this will launch the Live Chat application), and an agent will be able to help you – it’s fast and free.

                    <p>The most popular and cost-effective type of 3D model available is the Passive 3D TV. The glasses that are designed to view Passive 3D are battery-free, inexpensive and much lighter and comfortable to wear than those for Active 3D TVs. They are key to the 3D viewing experience, helping to create the third dimensional effect on-screen by showing each eye a slightly different image. <br/><p style="color=#578bc1; font-weight: bolder;">If the problem is not resolved, please <a href="#">click here for Live Chat</a> (this will launch the Live Chat application), and an agent will be able to help you – it’s fast and free.

                  <div class='answer'>
                    <p>All our TVs support VGA input via PC or Mac. HDMI input is also supported on our TVs. Computers use a wide variety of graphics cards so there can be quite a variety of compatibility issues. To help with any compatibility issues, you can download a utility called PowerStrip which provides multi-monitor, programmable hardware support to a wide range of graphics cards.

                  <div class='answer'>
                    <p>You need to connect the Blu-ray player (3D compatible) with a high speed HDMI cable (V1.4) to your TV.  Note that 3D glasses are only required when watching 3D content.<br/><br/>
By default the PS3 will output a standard signal via the HDMI connection, therefore you may need to follow the below instructions to activate 3D on the PS3:<br/>
	•	Have both the TV and console turned off.<br/>
	•	Turn on the TV and wait for it to power up, then turn on the console (hold the power button until it beeps).<br/>
	•	The PS3 will then identify the 3D TV and ask for resolution information and screen size.<br/><br/>
Once selected, the PS3 will then have the ability to play both games and Blu-ray 3D discs.

The sound will only output from the Freeview.

                  <div class='answer'>
                    <p>Your licence fee covers the five main TV channels from BBC1 to Channel 5.  As long as you can pick up these channels, then your TV is not faulty.  However, please remember that the quality of your TV aerial will determine the quality of the signal.  Some areas may be receiving a weak signal or a signal from a relay transmitter which will not broadcast additional channels such as Dave etc. <br/><p style="color=#578bc1; font-weight: bolder;">If the problem is not resolved, please <a href="#">click here for Live Chat</a> (this will launch the Live Chat application), and an agent will be able to help you – it’s fast and free.

                  <div class='answer'>
                    <p>The problem can be caused by various factors depending on the source of the image and its connection to the TV. If you are not using a digital television/aerial connection, then remove and reattach cables, or try a new cable. Also check another appliance connected via this source or try connecting to another TV to see if the same issue persists.<br/><p style="color=#578bc1; font-weight: bolder;">If the problem is not resolved, please <a href="#">click here for Live Chat</a> (this will launch the Live Chat application), and an agent will be able to help you – it’s fast and free.
